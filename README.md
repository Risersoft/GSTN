# GSTN 
GSTN API Client

This project is an open source strongly typed client for GSTN APIs as per http://developer.gstsystem.co.in/apiportal/

This work was born due to GST integration in Risersoft (www.risersoft.com) Etomplan manufacturing ERP (www.etomplan.com).
Subsequently it was also used in Risersoft GstNirvana Project (www.risersoft.com/gst).

We are releasing it into open source for the benefit of community and in accordance with our belief that GST requires rigorous collaboration on the part of everybody in the ecosystem.

We thank the community for the great response as we see that scores of projects have been benefited from this work. Going forward, we solicit support and suggestions of the community to maintain this as per the APIs released by GSTN.


Usage:
- GSTN is constantly evolving the APIs.
- Hence, it is recommended to use the GSTN.API.Library.dll directly in your projects
- This will enable easy updation in case of change
- For closed source library with a more up-to-date implementation, pl refer https://github.com/Risersoft/GST-API-Sample/
